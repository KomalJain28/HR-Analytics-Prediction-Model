# HR-Analytics-Prediction-Model
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning, specifically logistic regression. The data preprocessing steps included handling missing values by filling in null entries, balancing the dataset using sampling techniques, and addressing outliers in numerical features through IQR-based winsorization. Categorical variables were converted using one-hot encoding and label encoding to ensure proper model interpretation. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model was applied. The model achieved a training precision of 0.64 and a testing precision of 0.66, demonstrating a reasonable fit for predicting employee attrition.
